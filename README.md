# Simple-LLM-App-AI

<h2 tabindex="-1" class="heading-element" dir="auto">Introduction</h2>
In this ever evolving world of Machine Learning and AI technologies, this article provides as a guide for building a simple Large Language Model (LLM) with Python which revolves about a personal AI personal assistant.

The picture below shows the final output of the app which allows you to enter any text and the model will generate the best possible human language reply.

<h2 tabindex="-1" class="heading-element" dir="auto">Prerequisites</h2>
This includes:

1. Python (3.5+), and background writing Python scripts.

  
2. OpenAI: OpenAI is a research organization and technology company that aims to ensure artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. One of its key contributions is the development of advanced LLMs such as GPT-3 and GPT-4. These models can understand and generate human-like text, making them powerful tools for various applications like chatbots, content creation, and more.
Sign up for OpenAI and copy your API keys from the API section in your account so that you can access the models.  Install OpenAI on your computer using the command below:

4. Streamlit: Streamlit is a powerful and easy-to-use Python library for creating web applications. Streamlit allows you to create interactive web applications using Python alone. You don't need expertise in web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to build functional and visually appealing web apps.
It's beneficial for building machine learning and data science apps, including those that utilize LLMs. Install streamlit on your computer using the command below:

Another workaround to install all the dependancies faster would be to create a "requirements.txt" in the same directory of the project and run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the dependancies all at once.
